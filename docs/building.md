# Building instructions

!!! warning "Before you really consider this..."
	I've built this rack several years ago, and have been using it since then. However, I do not have physical access to the rack at the moment. I used some time off to publish this work, and in order to do so, I had to change some part of the code. The 4 years old one I'm using didn't build anymore. I'm ==unable to test== this changes at the moment, so please reach to me first if you really considering building the rack !

The project is built around three repositories :

 * @blemasle/mls800-pcb : The motherboard and daughterboard PCBs
 * @blemasle/mls800-firmware : The firmware that needs to be loaded on to the motherboard
 * @blemasle/mls800-case : The CAD files needed to produce the case
